# Oregon Adventure - a Hangman-style Game

An exercise to re-create my original Oregon Adventure game using the React library.

## About the Game

It's Hangmanâ€”with an Oregon Trail twist. You're a pioneer traversing America on a journey to Oregon. Guess the letters correctly and you continue on your way. Guess incorrectly and your family members sadly suffer from 1800s-era maladies.

Can you survive your Oregon Adventure?
